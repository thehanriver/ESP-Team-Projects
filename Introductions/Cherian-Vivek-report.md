## Solution Design
I followed the instructions laid out in the skills and reference materials given to us. To answer the question regarding certain git commands: git pull pulls in changes from a remote repo to your local one; git commit takes a snapshot of changes made since the last commit; git push sends your local commits to a remote repo. Generally, your workflow with a Github repository will be pulling in changes to get your local branches up to date, committing the changes you make as you work, and then pushing your commits to the remote repo so that collaborators can pull them.
