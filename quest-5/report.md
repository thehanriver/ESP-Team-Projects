## Summary

For designing our cruise control rover, we implemented all the skills from this cluster into one rover. Since, all three of use were on campus,
we decided to test the speed sensor and movement on one rover and PID in another. The "demo" rover would be LIDR with I2C. At the end, we compiled all
our sensors into the "demo" rover.

The node server was copied from our last quest with many things taken out so it only has an on off button which is nothing special. It sends a response of 
1 or 0 to the esp to determine if the rover should start or stop.
