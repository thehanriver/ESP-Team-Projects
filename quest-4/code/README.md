The main forder contains code for flashing onto the ESP. The ESPs all have the same code, the only thing to change when flashing each ESP is to give them a seperate ID. There is also an array of IPs for each esp which would need to be changed depending on which esps are used. The ESP code can be run by building and then flashing it onto a ESP. 

The node forlder contains all the code for running the node.js server. This code can be run on either a laptop or on a raspberry pi by running node index.js while in the folder.
